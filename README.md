> [!NOTE]
> Layers are exported in the same hierarchy as they are in the layers tab of Adobe Photoshop. Groups are folders, the rest of the elements are individual images in these folders.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> Any SmartObject is rasterized during the export process, which means that everything inside it will be combined into one image.<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use Cyrillic symbols for the names of layers and groups, this may disrupt the script's operation!
